					<p>A nameless fifteen-year-old runs away to Los Angeles, seeking life beyond the harsh constraints of 
					her evangelical upbringing. She is the narrative of her passage, from her escape on a bus through her 
					quiet, determined progress across the city's unforgiving terrain. The journey takes her into and around 
					the lives of Angelinos from all walks: a dancer whose hyperactive sense of smell makes her fiance's 
					presence insufferable; a penniless botanist who earns her keep creating sugar-icing flowers to decorate 
					glamorous wedding cakes she can never afford; a dentist lamenting the abuses done to the teeth of a patient 
					for whom he has cared dutifully. Her odd encounters, set against the backdrop of Los Angeles's flagrant 
					wealth, cast into relief its eccentricities and the everyday trials faced by its collection of lost souls. 
					Together these stories reflect and refract one another, illuminating a poignant, unflinching portrait of 
					loss and the search for identity in its wake.
